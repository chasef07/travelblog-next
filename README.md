# Chase Fagen Travel Journal

A personal travel journal built with Next.js 16 and React 19. The site combines a date-based reader, a 3D world view, country dossiers, and food, video, and packing notes from the route.

## Features

- Journal home with the latest entry and date-matched entries from prior years
- Monthly Archives and individual Posts with canonical paths and reading times
- Interactive Three.js globe with a country flag index and Country dossiers
- Food, vlog, and carry-on packing collections
- RSS feed, sitemap, structured data, and social metadata
- Responsive App Router interface with parallel-route detail panels
- Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights

## Stack

- Next.js 16.2 and React 19.2
- TypeScript 6
- Tailwind CSS 4 and shadcn/ui primitives
- React Three Fiber, Drei, and Three.js
- Bun 1.3.11

Production builds use Webpack because the globe integration is configured for it.

## Getting started

Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/) 1.3.11 or a compatible version, then run:

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

bun run dev          # Start the development server with Webpack
bun test             # Run the Bun test suite
bun run format       # Format the repository
bun run format:check # Check formatting
bun run lint         # Run ESLint
bun run build        # Create a production build with Webpack

```

## Adding a Blog Post

1. Add the Post record to `src/content/blog-posts/YYYY-month.ts`.
2. Import and spread that month into `allBlogPosts` in `src/content/blog-registry.ts`.
3. Add an explicit `BlogArchive` record when the month needs curated title, excerpt, or image metadata. The publication module derives an Archive when one is omitted.
4. Put local images under `public/assets/images/` and reference them with `/assets/images/...` paths.
5. Run `bun test && bun run check`.

The raw registry is the source of content records. `src/content/blog/publication.ts` is the sole module that validates calendar identity and derives canonical paths, missing Archives, reading times, static parameters, country projections, and card-image fallbacks.

## Configuration and deployment

The site builds for Vercel with `bun run build`. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` only when Google Analytics is required; Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights are included directly in the root layout.

Site identity, canonical URL, and social metadata live in `src/lib/seo.ts`.
