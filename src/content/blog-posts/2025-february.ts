    excerpt: 'Discovering a hidden gem - a fishing island turned resort paradise with saunas, cold plunges, and learning to backflip.',
    content: `I am in a small fishing island off the southwest of Cambodia. Nobody came to this island until a hostel chain, Mad Monkey, opened a beautiful hostel. It is more of a resort. For 8 dollars a night it includes a sauna, steam room, cold plunge, jacuzzi, infinity pool, outdoor gym, private beach, and comfy beds. It opened a month ago. I rushed here to get into a nice routine, relax, and unwind. As you know I love saunas and cold plunges. I have taken the past couple of days to disconnect and improve my mind and body. Yesterday I went out on a boat with people from the hostel and we banana boated and fished. It was a lot of fun. I am very proud to announce that I am a part of the flip community or flipper community. I learned how to do a backflip from the boat! I never thought I would be a flipper but I was able to do it pretty easily on my first try. Another tool to my tool belt. I also learned that I like Flat White coffee. I never heard of this type of coffee in the US. A flat white is an espresso-based coffee drink made with a shot (or double shot) of espresso and steamed milk, topped with a thin layer of microfoam (smooth, velvety milk foam). It originated in Australia or New Zealand and is known for its strong coffee flavor and silky texture. Essentially, if you prefer a bolder coffee taste with a creamy texture, go for a flat white. If you like a milkier, smoother drink, a latte is a better choice. I will be chilling in Koh Sdach for another couple of days before moving on to another island of Cambodia. Shabbat Shalom.`,

    excerpt: 'First impressions of Cambodia\'s capital - cleaner and more developed than expected, with Japanese influence and great sauna culture.',
    content: `Good afternoon from Phnom Penh. Before I give my first impressions of Cambodia I think I need to go back to my Lao review to give it the respect it deserves. I entered Lao solo traveling, with little plan and no bookings. I embraced the spontaneity of the adventure, not booking accommodation or tickets in advance. I really liked traveling this way. You get cheaper deals, and better finds. It always worked out thankfully. I was able to change my plans on a dime because I had all the flexibility in the world. That is all. I took a 10 hour bus from Don Det to the capital of Cambodia, Phnom Penh, yesterday. I booked the VIP bus for 35 dollars which had nice reclining chairs, solid wifi and a meal included. It was totally worth it. The ride was super long and exhausting but not the worst thing. Immediately when I arrived in Phnom Penh I realized it was way nicer and cleaner than I expected. Maybe this is because I was coming from Lao. Walking around today I was really impressed. There are really nice high rise apartments being built, tons of vibe cafes, and a bunch of international restaurants. Today I started my day by going to the sauna and cold plunge. I found a place for five dollars. Wow it made me feel amazing after a 10 hour bus ride. It makes my body and mind sharp. I would do it everyday if I could. I walked around the city and saw Japanese influence with sushi restaurants, flags, and more. As I said the city is pretty clean for a SE Asian city. I went to the mall to get some toiletries. It was really nice being able to be a consumer again. I like consuming. I think being in Lao for a month gassed me. Now I have the option of what kind of food to eat, where to go and more. It is nice and is making me feel better. Taking it chill today before heading to the islands. I need to learn more about Cambodian culture and some basic phrases. I find myself saying Lao phrases because I was in so deep!`,

    excerpt: 'Final days in Laos on the river island of Don Det, reflecting on a month of authentic cultural immersion and planning the next adventure.',
    content: `I am in Don Det. I left the organic farm yesterday (Thursday) morning. Don Det is part of the very southern region of Lao called the "4000 islands" It is a group of islands in the Mekong River. A river island! Don Det is solely a backpacker destination. I arrived and an older gentleman named Adrian sold me a bungalow with a Riverview and hammock for 10 dollars. This place is like stepping back in time he said. He was a backpacker for many years and decided to settle down here. I have noticed a handful of older, western gentleman who are staying here long term. It is laid back with nothing to do, nice nature, and rustic. I read online that it is a backpackers paradise. I could see that. If you want to chill in a hammock all day by the river and ride a bicycle around, this is the place for you. Adrian, the old British guy who sold me the bungalow, also wrote a book. He sold me on his book too. It is titled "South East Asia In Yer Face". It is a chronicles of his backpacking experiences. He seemed nice and genuine and a good story teller so I bought it for 10 dollars. Today I biked around the island. It is really hot here. I was deciding whether to stay another day or leave to Cambodia. After much contemplation I realized my time in Lao, a month as of today, is complete and finished and I will leave tomorrow. While I think of it, here are my Lao highlights: Lao herbal steam room, Nong Khiaw nature and trekking, and waving, smiling, cute kids. It was an incredible, authentic experience into a culture that is still intact, and not overrun by tourists. Though quite poor, they live happily. It is sad that they do not have much social mobility or path to make more money and move up the ladder. I think I am feeling this tension of what to do because I need a new experience. Hopefully Cambodia, a new country and culture will reinvigorate me. Also I am looking forward to meeting new people. In Thailand I met a lot of people, because it is a backpacker hub. Then a subset follow the route to Lao. Lao is a lot less backpacked. I got tired of seeing the same faces in lao on the same route. I was able to break away from it after leaving Vang Vieng. Also I was staying in privates because it is just as cheap as dorms. Now all of the sudden I have the desire to go back to social hostels and hopefully meet a new batch of fresh faces. I am looking to a lot of time on the Cambodian beaches, and the equinox in Angkor Wat. I want to stay in places longer as I mentioned instead of bouncing around. I will first try this on the Cambodian beaches. Maybe I should let you all know a couple new places came on my radar recently. I am interested in going to Chengdu, China and exploring Indonesia thoroughly for a month. The next part of this trip will consist of a lot of beach and surf time. I will make sure to get lost on the way too don't worry. I liked the time on the farm and days like today to chill and relax, but now I have a fire to pick up the gears! One month until the equinox! 1.5 months until my birthday!`,

    excerpt: 'Deep reflections on farm life, the purpose of travel, and contemplating the future while chopping wood and building websites.',
    content: `Time to reflect. This will be a hardcore flow of consciousness. Today I chopped wood for a solid hour. It was interesting doing something so primal and so repetitive. I reflected how people used to do this for thousands of years to make fire and thousands of people still do this today. Is chopping wood about accuracy or precision? Chopping one piece takes a while. You miss the mark many times but eventually you create a singular crease which goes deeper and deeper. Is there a metaphor in here for life? Probably. You have to keep shooting shots around a targeted goal, and eventually you will succeed. The past 5 days I have been living in the 3rd world, maybe 3.5 world fully. I appreciate the 1st world more than ever. I thought farm life would be relaxing and liberating. It has those aspects but I still crave more. I like seeing different places and meeting different people on a day to day basis. On the farm you walk around the same 200 square meters all day. I like places with a nice river, clean air, and more walkability. I have never missed a nice mall more than now. Maybe I am not a farm guy, or this is just not my conception of farm life. The days are slow but they somehow have passed by quickly. I think it was because I worked on the website for a good portion. By the way sharedhappyfarm.com is live now. It was nice giving a small Lao business immediate value with my technical skills. It is so much more than what I could have given in the kitchen or the farm. I really needed to be hand held in the kitchen and farm aspects unfortunately. I think with technology and AI we are really becoming a different species which is sad but also exciting. I used AI to help make the website for them. I am not even kidding it accomplished a task in a couple hours it would take me weeks to do without it. It is really scary and exciting how powerful this AI stuff will be. Why was I born into this body at this time? Why were you not born into the body of a rural Lao child? These are kind of silly questions to ask but it makes you wonder… What is my purpose here? I have slept terribly since being here. Last night I was a little sick and I think I was tossing and turning all night. I might have even been hallucinating I am not sure if I was truly asleep. I think I sweat out my fever though and feeling better. I have been dreaming about death recently. I got shot by a Joker-esque character in my dream a couple nights ago. Whenever I die in a dream a warm sensation covers my body and I wake up. I am an intellectual at heart. I should devote more focused time to intellectual activities. I used this time on the farm to slow down from moving so much. I am not sure if the farm actually rejuvenated me. Am I getting travel fatigue? I am almost 5 months in. I might be getting tired from moving place to place, following some route. I should do more crazy things. This was a crazy thing too. I said I was going to be radically present. I think I am improving but still not there yet. We are less than two months out from my 25th birthday. Wow! I drove a semi-automatic motorbike on the Thakhek loop and I thought about shifting into different gears. These next 2 months I will be shifting up to gear 4. But everyone knows you cannot drive in gear 4 always. You have to dance between gear 3,2,1, and even neutral. It is designed into the cosmic blueprint that the winter is for lower gears, slower life. I can feel my engine rumbling. It has been rumbling for a while. I might leave the farm tomorrow. I might not. It depends how I sleep. My body is in shambles from these beds. I might hitchhike back to Pakse. I might not. I have never hitchhiked but think it would complete my Lao experience. If you are reading this I appreciate you. Thank you for being alive, thank you for caring about me. I care about you.`,
