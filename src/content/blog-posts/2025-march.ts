    excerpt: 'One of the coolest days of my life - buying a Honda Wave motorbike in Vietnam and riding 122km to Ninh Binh to start an epic adventure.',
    content: `This was one of the coolest days of my life. I came to Vietnam with really no plan, arriving late Saturday night. Today, I bought a motorbike to explore the country.

I had heard of people buying motorbikes in Vietnam to reach harder-to-access landscapes, but since I'm already deep into my trip, I wasn't sure if I'd have the energy to do it. On Sunday, I randomly walked into a bike shop and talked to the French owner, who gave me tons of info. He told me about an amazing off-the-beaten-path route in northern Vietnam, what to do if I got pulled over by the police, and the pros and cons of renting vs. buying. He was great.

After our conversation, I went on Facebook and joined almost 10 different Vietnam backpacker and motorbike groups. The French shop owner told me exactly what bike to look for: a Honda Wave, 110cc, semi-automatic. While scrolling through Facebook, I saw a listing for this exact bike. I messaged the seller, and it turned out he was staying at the same hostel as me! His name is Tuur, a Belgian guy living in Koh Tao. He was selling the bike for a really good price—7.5 million dong.

I was skeptical about buying anything through Facebook groups, but when I met him in person, he seemed like a super authentic, down-to-earth guy. This morning, I test-drove the bike, and it rode great. He told me he had recently serviced it, and it was a champ. We agreed on the price, and I bought the bike!

It took almost 1.5 hours to figure out how to transfer the money. Europeans use an app called Revolut, which has issues with American accounts. My brother Blake came in super clutch and helped us out—thanks, bro, I love you! I had to Apple Cash Blake, who then put money on his Revolut and sent it to me so I could transfer it to Tuur. Don't ask me why.

The bike came with a phone holder, a rack for bags, and bungee cords to secure them. The French bike dealer told me to get an oil change every 500 km, which I plan to do. You need a blue card for vehicle registration, which I got. Technically, you're supposed to have an international driver's license, but nobody does. The cops try to pull you over for bribes, but there are ways around it.

After buying the bike, I drove 122 km from Hanoi to Ninh Binh! It was a chill drive, but really cold—I had to layer up. I also bought a new helmet with a face shield because the one Tuur had didn't have one, and bugs are bound to fly in your face.

I arrived in Ninh Binh and stayed at a $4 hostel. I chilled and went to the Laying Dragon Viewpoint, flew my drone there, and got some good shots. Afterward, I hit the sauna and had goat meat for dinner—this town is known for goat for some reason.

It was a long day of driving, but I'm moving forward tomorrow. So stoked!`,

    excerpt: 'First day in Vietnam\'s capital - trying egg coffee, reuniting with travel friend Ben, and exploring the infamous Hoa Lo Prison.',
    content: `Today was my first full day in Vietnam, in the northern city of Hanoi. At first impression, it's my least favorite city in all of Southeast Asia. It's too touristy, there's not much to do, and people are constantly trying to sell you stuff and haggle with you. The food, however, is really good.

In the morning, I went to a café and tried the famous egg coffee. It was thick, creamy, and delicious. After that, I hit the gym and had a solid workout—it cost just over a dollar, which was a big difference from China. It feels strange being back on the third-world backpacker route, but I adjusted pretty quickly. Honestly, I adjust quickly anywhere at this point.

After the gym, I met up with my good friend Ben Shifrin from Dunwoody, GA. Ben and I first met in Chiang Mai, Thailand, after I noticed his Dead & Co. sticker. Since then, we've crossed paths in Pai, Chiang Rai, Vang Vieng, and now Hanoi. It's always awesome running into a fellow American Jewish backpacker with so much in common. We laughed, shared experiences, and I felt really grateful for his friendship and the moments we've shared.

Later, we visited the Hỏa Lò Prison. Originally, it was used by the French during their occupation of Indochina to imprison Vietnamese political dissidents who opposed colonial rule. The museum spent a lot of time detailing how brutally the French treated Vietnamese prisoners. After Vietnam gained independence, the same prison was used to house American POWs, mostly captured fighter pilots during the Vietnam War. According to the museum, the Americans were treated well—they were allowed to play sports, and supposedly, they were even given food more expensive than what the locals ate. It's always funny seeing the bias in museums. This was the infamous prison where John McCain was held. Of course, the reality is that the Vietnamese tortured American prisoners.

Oh, before the prison visit, I had my first phở of the trip, and it was really good. After the museum, Ben and I grabbed bánh mì, a famous Vietnamese sandwich. I never understood the hype back home, and I still don't—it's literally just a sandwich. I guess the bread, a French baguette, is what makes it bánh mì. That influence, of course, comes from French colonialism.

At night, we went to Train Street and watched the famous train pass through a narrow alley lined with cafés. It was actually pretty cool.

Tomorrow, I (hopefully) leave Hanoi and start a crazy adventure. Stay tuned for updates.`,

    excerpt: 'Relaxing in Chengdu with traditional Chinese massage, celebrating Shabbat with local expats, and sleeping overnight at a unique 24/7 life spa.',
    content: `After two long days at the national park, I took the day to chill. In the morning, I hit the gym and had a solid workout. In the afternoon, I got cupping again and a traditional Chinese massage.

The massage was... interesting. The lady rubbed my muscles in ways I hadn't experienced before. It wasn't very intense, but she managed to hit the right spots. Traditional Chinese massage often includes moxibustion, a practice where dried mugwort is burned near the skin to promote healing and circulation. The heat from the burning mugwort (called moxa) is believed to stimulate the flow of qi and blood. Afterward, she advised me not to drink cold beverages, as Chinese medicine teaches that cold can slow circulation and interfere with the body's ability to heal by constricting blood vessels and stagnating qi.

After the massage, I felt both alert and relaxed—maybe my nervous system got a boost.

That evening, I celebrated Shabbat at Chabad of Chengdu. I originally went to the address listed on Google Maps, which turned out to be 30 minutes outside the city—and completely wrong. Luckily, an Israeli guy I met at my hostel, Tair, sent me the correct location. I was the last one to arrive due to the fiasco, but the atmosphere was intimate, with only about 25 people.

I met Inbar, an Israeli woman who moved to Chengdu to study Chinese medicine. The rabbi was super warm and energetic, similar to Mendy. It was refreshing to be at a smaller Shabbat table rather than a massive one for travelers. A lot of the Israelis there were either trying to start businesses or had already settled in Chengdu.

One of the most interesting people I met was Ezra Haleva, a 25-year-old who had worked at Microsoft, quit his job, and was now trying to build software in Chengdu. He was easily one of the funniest guys I've ever met. It was amazing connecting with so many cool and different people. The food was solid, too.

After Shabbat, I went out briefly with Ezra, Tair, and another guy. Then I checked into my accommodation for the night: Tang Yue Life Spa. It's open 24/7, and you can actually stay overnight there. I did a midnight sauna and jacuzzi before trying to sleep.

I assumed there would be a dedicated sleeping area, but nope—it was every man for himself. You just had to find a spot on the ground. I managed to claim a nice corner, but there were at least 500 people staying the night. I slept as well as you possibly can when you're on the floor, surrounded by hundreds of strangers.

It was definitely a super unique experience.`,
