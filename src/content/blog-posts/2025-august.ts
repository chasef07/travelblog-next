    excerpt: 'Reverse culture shock and finding home again after a year of global adventures. Reflections on returning to Florida and what "home" means now.',
    content: `After nearly a year of traveling around the world, I'm back home in Florida. The reverse culture shock is real, but so is the gratitude for this incredible journey.

**The Journey's End**
Stepping off the plane at Tampa International Airport felt surreal. Almost a year ago, I left Florida with a backpack and a dream to see the world. Now I'm back with a head full of memories, a heart full of gratitude, and a completely different perspective on life.

**Reverse Culture Shock**
Everything feels so... big here. The cars, the portions, the highways, the houses. After months of cramped buses, tiny motorbikes, and modest accommodations, American excess is jarring. But there's also comfort in familiarity - clean water from the tap, reliable electricity, and yes, even good customer service.

**What I Learned**
This year taught me that home isn't just a place - it's a feeling. I felt at home in a Nepalese tea house, a Laotian village, a Georgian mountain town, and countless other places along the way. But there's something special about the place where your story began.

**Gratitude**
I'm grateful for:
- The people who welcomed me into their homes and cultures
- Fellow travelers who became lifelong friends
- Challenges that made me stronger
- Beauty that left me speechless
- Experiences that changed my perspective forever

**What's Next**
This journey may be ending, but it's really just the beginning. The world feels smaller now, but also more connected. The friends I made, the places I've been, the person I've become - these will all stay with me forever.

Thank you to everyone who followed along on this incredible adventure. The best journeys are the ones you share, and sharing this with all of you made it even more meaningful.

Florida will always be home, but now I know that home can be anywhere you choose to find it.`,
