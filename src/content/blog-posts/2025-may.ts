    excerpt: 'Exploring the tropical paradise of the Philippines - from world-class surfing in Siargao to canyoneering in Cebu.',
    content: `May was all about island life in the Philippines! After my intense month of motorbiking through Vietnam, I was ready for some beach time and tropical adventures.

The Philippines delivered everything I hoped for and more:

**Siargao - Surfing Paradise**
Learned to surf properly on Cloud 9, one of the world's most famous breaks. The island vibe here is incredible - laid back, friendly locals, and perfect waves.

**Palawan - Underground Wonders**
Explored the Underground River in Puerto Princesa and island-hopped around El Nido with its stunning limestone cliffs and crystal-clear lagoons.

**Cebu - Canyoneering Adventure**
The canyoneering experience in Kawasan Falls was absolutely epic - jumping off cliffs, swimming through canyons, and rappelling down waterfalls.

**Bohol - Natural Wonders**
Visited the famous Chocolate Hills and swam with whale sharks - a bucket list experience that exceeded all expectations.

The Filipino people are some of the friendliest I've encountered anywhere. Their hospitality and positive energy made every day special. Plus, the food scene is incredible - fresh seafood, tropical fruits, and unique local dishes.

This month reminded me why Southeast Asia is such a special region for backpackers. The combination of natural beauty, adventure activities, and warm culture makes the Philippines an absolute gem.`,
