    content: `June was all about Indonesia - a country that completely exceeded my expectations! From the moment I landed in Jakarta, I knew this month was going to be special.

**Bali - The Island of Gods**
Started in Bali where I spent weeks learning to surf properly. The waves at Uluwatu and Padang Padang are world-class, and the surf culture here is incredible. When I wasn't in the water, I was exploring ancient temples like Tanah Lot and Pura Besakih.

**Yogyakarta - Cultural Heart**
Flew to Yogya to experience traditional Javanese culture. Visited the incredible Borobudur and Prambanan temples at sunrise - some of the most spectacular ancient architecture I've ever seen.

**Flores & Komodo**
The highlight was definitely seeing Komodo dragons in their natural habitat. These prehistoric creatures are absolutely massive and intimidating. The boat trip through Komodo National Park also had some of the best snorkeling of my life.

**Jakarta - Urban Indonesia**
Ended the month in Jakarta experiencing modern Indonesian city life. The food scene here is incredible - from street food to high-end restaurants, Indonesian cuisine is so diverse and flavorful.

Indonesia's diversity is mind-blowing - over 17,000 islands, hundreds of languages, and countless unique cultures. Every island feels like a different country. The people are incredibly warm and welcoming, and the natural beauty is unmatched.

This month reminded me why Southeast Asia is such an incredible region for travelers. Indonesia definitely earned a spot as one of my favorite countries on this trip.`,
