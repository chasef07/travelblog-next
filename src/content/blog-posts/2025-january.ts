    excerpt: 'A transformative 3-day excursion featuring mountain camping, traditional ceremonies, and immersive cultural experiences in a Lao weaving village.',
    content: `I am back in Nong Khiaw after a great 3 day 2 night excursion. On Wednesday night we hiked to the top of one of the highest view points in Nong Khiaw. It was a 2 hour hike where we climbed elevation pretty quickly. There were about 20 people in the entire group. The majority of people were either British or Dutch. The tour started at 13:30 and we arrived to the viewpoint around 16:00. At the top I read some of my book and we enjoyed a pretty nice sunset while overlooking the town. At night we made a camp fire and camped in tents. It was one of the most uncomfortable nights of sleep of my life. At first I was cold and then I was hot. I slept on my side for 30 minutes then my hip hurt so bad I had to switch to the other side. I tossed and turned all night. In the morning we awoke to watch the sunrise which was nice, but not amazing. It was advertised you would wake to a "sea of clouds" covering the mountains but it was not the right conditions Thursday morning. After watching the sunrise we hiked downhill to the town. From there, the majority of the group left as they only booked a one night excursion. 8 total people remained to carry on to the next day. It was all Dutch people and one other American. Thursday was a great day where we trekked to a waterfall, went deep into a cave, and went to a remote village, Sopchem, for a homestay. The homestay was absolutely the best part of the trip. The village has a singular dirt road where everyone lives off of. This dirt road is lined with women selling scarves and tote bags. It is known as a "weaving village" due to the many women selling their handmade scarves and goods. Around the campfire at night one of the Dutch guys on the trip proposed we join the locals in drinking which we saw down the street. I immediately said yes because I am all for those types of immersive cultural experiences. Me and two dutch guys walked down the dirt road at night barefoot to ask the locals to join them in drinking BeerLao and Lao Lao whiskey. The locals did not speak a lick of English but we got by through gesticulation. They gladly welcomed us and we laughed and shared some drinks. After about five minutes they made a gesture of wrapping something around our wrist and sent us inside the house. Inside there were about 15 Lao women sitting and eating. Immediately they welcome us and start putting on white cloth strings around our wrists. We had no ideas what was happening but went with the experience. They did not just put one cloth string on my wrist but about 20! My wrists were full. They were saying prayers over us. I guessed this was some kind of Buddhist ritual but had no idea still. I donated some money to the elderly woman by tying 100,000 kip around her wrist. Inside we all laughed and enjoyed. The first thing I immediately noticed was how the old women seemed so energetic, healthy, and alive. In the US I associate elderly people with low energy but these women were smiling and so alive! It was so nice to see them enjoying life. In their small village they just weave all day and enjoy community. They really do seem happier and healthier than the elderly population in the west. Also inside the home there were many kids running about even though it was close to 2200. They were so cute and playful! After we spent a good 30 minutes inside with the women we returned outside to drink with the men. The separation of women and men reminded me of an orthodox jewish gathering. Outside we did a couple shots with the locals and continued to laugh and gesticulate without language. It is amazing to me how much connection can occur with no language whatsoever. On the flip side language is so powerful. After returning to wifi on Friday afternoon I looked up what the white bracelet ceremony was. It was a ceremony called "Baci". This is a traditional Lao ritual to restore spiritual balance and well-being. The ceremony is deeply rooted in animist and Buddhist beliefs and is performed for various occasions like: welcoming travelers, new beginnings, special events. Since it was just recently Chinese new year I think this is what the celebration was for. The white cotton strings symbolize purity, protection, and good fortune. The strings are meant to keep your "Kwan" (soul energy) in place, ensuring harmony and good luck. Animism is the belief that everything in nature has a spirit and must be respected. Although Theravada Buddhism is the main religion in Laos, it blends with animist traditions. It was such a cool experience to really be in the local village and see their traditions in action. The people were so warm, welcoming and lovely. I strive to emulate this hospitality and love of life.`,

    excerpt: 'Learning about the Secret War in Laos at Ban Man Da Museum and preparing for a mountain excursion.',
    content: `It is a cool and sunny 60 degrees Fahrenheit, 16 celsius here in Nong Khiaw Wednesday morning. I am feeling awake, energized and excited for the day. Today I start a three day, two night excursion. It will entail camping high in a mountain and awaking to a sea of clouds, trekking to a waterfall, staying with a local family and learning how to weave bamboo baskets, and kayaking down the Nam Ou River. Yesterday I went to the Ban Man Da Museum, a museum about how the Indochina War and Secret War affected the local people of Nong Khiaw. I used to not like museums, but I think it is really important to go to learn about the local culture and people. The Secret War in Laos refers to a covert military campaign led by the United States from 1964 to 1973 during the Vietnam War (2nd Indochina War). It was conducted primarily by the CIA and U.S. Air Force to combat the communist Pathet Lao and disrupt the Ho Chi Minh Trail, a key supply route used by North Vietnam through Laos and Cambodia.  The U.S. dropped over 2 million tons of bombs on Laos, making it the most heavily bombed country per capita in history. Many of these bombs remain unexploded, posing dangers to civilians today. The CIA recruited and trained the Hmong ethnic group to fight against the Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese forces. Hmong fighters, led by General Vang Pao, played a crucial role in guerrilla warfare. The war was kept secret from the American public and even Congress, as Laos was officially neutral under the 1954 Geneva Accords. Being at the museum I saw the plethora of bombs and explosives that were dropped years ago on the very ground I am standing on. One of the most staggering statistics about the Secret War in Laos is that from 1964 to 1973, the U.S. dropped an average of one bomb every 8 minutes, 24 hours a day, for 9 years. There was a cave at the museum where the local people of Nong Khiaw had to live in due to the intensity and frequency of the bombings. It was really startling to see so much damage done. As an American it poses an interesting ethical and moral dilemma today. How should I feel right now seeing the damages? I feel for the people of Lao and feel some remorse for my country. On the other hand I understand war is a dirty game and there are consequences. I never knew the details of the bombing campaign on Lao and how it was hidden from the American public and even congress! With all this in mind I feel the desire to give back to the people here. When you are traveling you take so much, but it is very important to balance this out with giving back. I have been wanting to volunteer on a farm for some time but have not found the right country or place or reason until now. At the bus station the other day I saw a poster for a nice organic farm and homestay I will try and work at in a week or two. After the museum yesterday I hiked to a beautiful viewpoint over Nong Khiaw. The green river running through the limestone mountains was serene. I am always in awe of creation, Mother Nature, and the people that make it special. There is no way that this is all entropy bro!`,

    excerpt: 'Arriving in the stunning village of Nong Khiaw and reflections on the richness of the German, Dutch, and French languages.',
    content: `Good evening from Nong Khiaw. Nong Khiaw is a small village 4 hours north of Luang Prabang known for incredible trekking and nature. The morning started with heading to the bus station at 8 am. I arrived at the bus station with a ticket, but my friend who decided to join along did not have one. The station told us that the tickets were sold out for the day. I did not want to abandon my friend so I was able to get a refund for my ticket. Just as we were about to leave a pair of French siblings said there is another station that has tickets. We decided to split a tuk-tuk to check out the local bus station. The bus station we arrived to at first was for tourists only. We drove about 20 minutes north in the cold and arrived at the local bus station, hoping there would be a bus. Luckily there was one in just 30 minutes! We got some snacks and road the four hour drive. The drive was pretty rough since the roads are not paved that well here. At times I got air borne from the bumps in the road. We arrived safely in Nong Khiaw around 1330. My friends that I met on the slow boat decided to book a full tour from Luang Prabang, but I told them I wanted to adventure on my own and figure everything out on the fly. I arrived in Nong Khiaw with no accommodation and walked the city for about 30 minutes. Most places were full or a little expensive. Finally I found an amazing place overlooking the river! Also I really like free styling the travels instead of booking a planned tour is because you get way better prices and finds. On my way to finding accommodation I saw so many posters for unique things and treks I never heard of. I explored the city the rest of the afternoon and am really excited for what this nature paradise holds. That is it for the day recap. I want to talk a little bit about languages. After hanging out with Germans, Dutch, and French people for the past couple days I for the first time realized the short comings of the English language. In german, dutch, and French my friends told me how there are way more words to describe how you are feeling and specific scenarios. In German and Dutch I guess there is a specific word for a happy birthday banner? Like the ones where it is a string and on the string it spells out happy birthday. Also there are way more words to express happiness or sadness or excitement. I asked ChatGPT why this is and got some interesting responses: German and Dutch can combine multiple words to create new ones, often resulting in highly descriptive terms. German and Dutch cultures have historically valued expressing complex human experiences, particularly in philosophy, art, and literature. Think of German philosophers like Kant and Schopenhauer, who explored emotions in depth and influenced the language to reflect such intricacies. English tends to borrow words from other languages rather than inventing its own. The richer vocabulary for emotions and scenarios in German and Dutch arises from their ability to combine words, cultural and historical influences, and linguistic structures that promote precision and creativity. English, while vast and versatile, has a different linguistic evolution that often depends on borrowing or explaining through phrases. Pretty cool right? I am feeling very grateful and appreciative for all my learnings and I am so happy to share it here. Tomorrow I look forward to doing a challenging trek and exploring more Lao culture.`,

    excerpt: 'Experiencing Lao culture, visiting the spectacular Kung Si waterfall, and bowling in Luang Prabang.',
    content: `After a few nights here in Lao I am starting to understand the culture and the people. The Lao people are a lot more friendly, laid back, and energetic than the Thai people. I think this happens in poorer countries for some reason. The people do not have much but they are grateful for what they have and for being alive. This reminds me of the energetic happy people of Africa. Luang Prabang feels safe and very authentic. There are monks walking around, lots of street food, and locals hanging out with their friend in the streets. It is very cheap here, even more than Thailand. One sad thing I have been realizing is the prevalence of child labor. At restaurants or any business, young children, as young as 8 or 10 years old takes orders or checks you out at the counter. All of the businesses are family run so it makes sense. Also I have seen so many children under the age of 14 riding motorcycles! It is pretty cool but quite dangerous. I really enjoy the lawlessness of some of these countries. They have way less laws than the west and are way safer. It is a cultural phenomenon which must be explored. Yesterday I rented a motorbike with the same group I went I came on the slow boat with and we went to the spectacular Kung Si waterfall. Having been to Iceland, Costa Rica, and places with spectacular waterfalls, I had low expectations. However, this waterfall was one of my favorites I have ever seen. The water was so fresh, so clear, and the landscapes so unique. I got in the waterfall pool and let the water hit the crown of my head, if you know you know. After the waterfall we found an awesome sunset spot off the main road. The sunsets in SE Asia have been spectacular. The air is cool and the sky is radiant. In the evening we all went out to the Luang Prabang Bowling Alley. Supposedly one of the best things to do for going out at night here is bowling. I was so confused why and was skeptical if it would be fun. We arrived around 21:00 and it was popping! The music was great and the alley was slammed. I bowled barefoot because when are you ever going to be able to do that again? Lao people were smoking inside and the alley itself was a little uneven. If you did not know I was on my middle school bowling team. I think of myself as a solid bowler and wanted to test my skills here in Lao. I bowled a 153 the second game which I was satisfied with. I only had three frames which were not strikes or spares. Bowling is timeless and fun. I have been having amazing night sleeps in the private room with a warm shower with good pressure! I am sad to go back to the dorms but need to continue to get good nights rest. I am probably changing cities tomorrow but I have no idea where!`,

    excerpt: 'Arriving in the UNESCO World Heritage city after the slow boat journey down the Mekong River.',
    content: `I just arrived in the UNESCO World Heritage city of northern Laos, Luang Prabang. Over the past 2 days I took the slow boat down the Mekong river. It was quite a unique and unforgettable experience. I travelled with 5 friends I met along the journey. It was really fun doing this slow boat experience together, I could not have imagined doing it alone. Nicole, Gunter, Lotte, Nicole, and I met in Chiang Rai at Get Hi Hostel. We all were headed to Laos the same day and teamed up to take the slow boat together. From Huay Xai we drove on the boat eight hours on Thursday to the small village of Pakbang. We did not have any accommodation booked so we searched the city to see what we could find. At first many places said they were fully booked, but I was optimistic. I ended up finding a nice guesthouse which cost us each about 4 dollars a night. In Pakbang I also met up with Anton who I met at my hostel in Chiang Mai. He joined our group to split costs and adventure together. In Pakbang we all ate dinner together but the service was terrible and the food took forever. I stocked up on snacks for the boat ride for the following morning because there is no food on the boat. I went with Pringles and some seaweed chips. Today, Friday we all woke up early to get good seats on the boat. It was another 8 hour day down the Mekong River. We had snack time, question time, story time, and percussion gun time. We laughed and got to know each other better. Even though sitting on a crowded boat for 16 hours over two days was painful on the body, the company and conversations made it all worth it. I would recommend any one coming from Thailand into Laos to do the slow boat experience because it is so unique. You pass through real jungle and dramatic limestone landscaped. You take occasional stops to drop off food and packages to local villages and see how the rural Lao people live. We saw many water buffalo too. Arriving in Luang Prabang around sunset I did not book any accommodation. As I discussed earlier I want to embrace more spontaneity and not plan too much. Typically I would book a hostel on hostel world but I wanted to see what the city had to offer. I learned going in person is usually much cheaper and can find unique gems. Anton Gunter and I had food at the night market and set off to find accommodation. We roamed the city and found a four dollar hostel dorm room first. My main rule is never buy the first thing you see, so I continued to compare prices. Also the hostel was on the main road and I was fearful the noise would be brutal. I walked and asked more than 10 places about accommodation. Either it was fully booked or way too expensive. I was not worried because I knew it would work out. This is the backpacker lifestyle. Every time a hotel said they were full I would ask where I should go to next that is cheap and available. Finally a nice gentleman whose place was already booked took me on his motorbike to his friend's hotel. The man offered 26 dollars for a private room and I got it down to 17. I was actually very happy for this price. After 2.5 weeks of dorm Iife and many snorlaxs waking me up I booked the private! I am hopeful I will get a good nights rest and be energized to explore Laos.`,

    excerpt: 'Welcome to Laos! First impressions of crossing the border and reflecting on Thailand highlights.',
    content: `Welcome to Laos! I travelled to Laos today with a group of friends I met at my hostel in Chiang Rai. We are going to take a two day slow boat down the Mekong River and arrive in the city of Luang Prabang on Friday. Let's start with some first impressions and history before giving my final remarks on Thailand. I crossed the land border into Laos this afternoon. Immediately on the other side of the border I noticed some differences. First, Laos appeared a lot poorer than Thailand. There were many buildings under construction and shopping strips with less developed infrastructure. This is supported by the following fact: As of 2023, Thailand's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is approximately $514.8 billion, with a GDP per capita of $7,336. In contrast, Laos has a GDP of about $14.9 billion and a GDP per capita of $1,999. On the other hand, I immediately noticed that the Lao people are much warmer and friendlier. While I was driving into the city from the boarder kids were running and waving and adults on motorcycles waved and greeted us as well. This never happened in Thailand once. I am looking forward to understanding the people and culture here more deeply, they seem very sweet. Now, the most shocking first impression of Laos was that next to every Laos flag there was the hammer and sickle flag, a known symbol of communism. Laos is one of the few remaining communist states in the world, governed by the Lao People's Revolutionary Party since 1975. The hammer and sickle here is used to emphasize the nation's commitment to its socialist principles. Here is a brief modern history of Laos. In the late 19th century Laos became part of French Indochina, alongside Vietnam and Cambodia. France established control over Laos in 1893, using it primarily as a buffer against British expansion in SE Asia. Laos gained independent from France in 1953 and established a monarchy, the Kingdom of Laos. However, the country was drawn into the Cold War, with the US and USSR supporting rival factions within the country. During this time the monarchy struggled to maintain control and communist insurgents, led by the Pathet Lao, gained strength from support from China and North Vietnam. Laos became heavily involved in the Vietnam Was due to its location along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. In 1975 after the US withdrawal from Vietnam, the Pathet Lao seized power, overthrowing the monarchy and declaring a communist state. Until today, the government tightly controls political expression, media and opposition. Laos faces issues like poverty, corruption and over reliance on foreign investment from China. I am excited to explore this country, its people and its roots for the next couple of weeks. Now to give Thailand its roses. My month in Thailand was amazing filled with so many different things. My highlights are: training Muay Thai, snorkeling in Koh Tao, NYE with Zach and Jacob, motorbike ride to Chiang Dao, and tubing in Pai. I definitely want to return to Thailand, specifically to explore the North and off-the-beaten path places along the Mekong River. The lowlights include: over-tourism in southern Thailand, lack of real Thai culture, lack of welcoming spirit from the locals. Laos is the first country I will be entering as a solo traveller and I am excited to go with the flow, meet new people, and get lost a little bit. Khớp khun kap Thailand and Sabaidee Laos!`,
