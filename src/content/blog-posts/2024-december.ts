    excerpt: 'Reflecting on personal growth and travel experiences while planning for 2025 adventures on the island of Koh Tao.',
    content: `Another rainy day! Let me see what is in my brain and comes to mind. Over the past couple years people have confused my nationality. I have gotten French most often. People have said I look French when I shave my head and when I have curly hair! Some people told me it is my clothing style, others say it is my "accent". I do not think I have an accent but I do believe I intonate my words in a unique way I guess. It is funny being an American in disguise. Others have noticed I am Jewish by my curly hair and start speaking to me in Hebrew, assuming I am Israeli. Once on the trip I even got Spanish! In Ko Tao right now it is about 35% people from the UK, 30% Israelis, and the remaining 25% is a mix between French, Spanish, German and Dutch. I met only one other American. It is sad Americans do not have the adventurous worldly spirit like the Europeans. I started writing my reflections of 2024 and my manifestations for 2025. I have done this the past two years and it has been cool going back and seeing the thoughts and ideas I would have. One thing huge comes to mind. 2025 will be the best year yet. Traveling has actually grounded me and solidified my perspectives and what I stand up for. The past two years I was very malleable, willing to learn and grow and try various experiences. I didn't really have things that I stood up for or solidified perspectives. I tried to be a sponge in everything I did. Now over the past three years of action packed experiences post college, I feel grounded and confident to sculpt my adult personality and draw red lines in the sand. Like I mentioned before, the age of 25 is where they say your pre frontal cortex becomes fully developed. I am really happy with how this trip has been shaping me and began to solidify my perspectives. This as I have mentioned, will make me a better brother, friend, son, husband, father. Going into the new year I have a vigor like never before. To continue to grow my intellectuality, my physicality, my emotionality, my spirituality. I think this perfectly coincides with when I will be solo traveling. Zach and I will split up in about a week and I will be alone for the rest of the travels. We have had an amazing 3.5 months together and I would not trade it for anything. That being said I am looking forward to the solo leg and seeing what it will bring. I will be traveling through north Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, the Philippines, and maybe more!`,

    excerpt: 'Deep dive into AI technology, data centers, and future opportunities while experiencing a rainy day in Koh Tao.',
    content: `First rainy day in Koh Tao, and first rainy day of the trip since Tskaltubo, Georgia! The rain makes you slow down and reflect on important things in life. This afternoon Zach and I spent time researching AI, energy, and the semiconductor industry. Zach brought up a good point that we have not talked about technology all trip. We have given ourself the space and time to think outside of what we were trained in through university and jobs, but now it is time to come back reinvigorated. If there was ever a clear market trend and wave of money flowing into an industry it is AI. There is not a single investor or futurist who is not onboard with the AI tsunami coming. With that being said, is there a way to make money from this tidal wave without working for a startup and selling your soul? We spitballed some interesting ideas. I spent some time learning about hydrogen fuel cells, high bandwidth memory chips, and networking subsystems. The state of the art data center being built by xAI requires 150 MW of power to run 100,000 GPUS and are scaling up. To put that into perspective, the average US home consumes about 1.2 kW. Therefore, the amount of power to run a data center could power about 125,000 US homes in a year! To power these data centers many companies are looking at building small modular nuclear reactors and hydrogen fuel cells. I have always been a fan of nuclear energy since learning the physics behind it in high school. There is a lot of innovation and engineering improvements to be had in this field and I am excited to follow it along. The last subtopic I want to comment on is that of networking in AI data centers. In the data centers you need fast, efficient, and low energy ways to move the data around. As AI scales, more and more data needs to be moved around the data center servers, and externally out of the data center in the fastest manner possible. In university I found a passion for photonics, the study of light. The datacenter today currently use 400 Gigabit/s ethernet protocol over fiber optic cable, but plan to scale to 800 and beyond. This can interestingly be achieved through advancements in silicon photonics. I could go on but I think that is enough for the tech talk. In the afternoon it stopped raining and Zach and I went to a latin party on the beach. I really enjoy latin culture and hope to make it to South America at the end of my trip to become really fluent in Spanish. I practiced my Spanish with Argentinians, Chileans, and spaniards. I actually got a compliment my Spanish is good! Argentina and Chile I am really interested in for the food, nature and skiing destinations. I am also interested in Colombia and Uruguay as well.`,

    excerpt: 'Defining my travel philosophy and sharing hidden gems like Dominical, Costa Rica and Lagos, Portugal.',
    content: `Having been fortunate enough to travel to many places I have finally created an understanding of my favorite type of travel. I will outline it now. The number one thing is to stay away from places that are too touristy. I value integrating into the local culture and having an authentic experience, so it is important to go to places which do not have too many people or tourists. Next, sight seeing is cool, but it can get old. Instead of going to see temples or various historical architecture sites I would rather find an experience to integrate into the culture or activity. That being said some cities you can really integrate into the culture. A city that comes to mind is Madrid, Spain or Kyoto, Japan. Both of these cities are site seeing cities but are culturally rich enough to make you feel like you are a part of the culture. Now combining these two tenants, 1. Not too touristy or too many people and 2. Integrate into the culture through experiences instead of site seeing too much you really narrow down your options. To zoom in more, I really enjoy places which are walkable or have really good public transit to get to other spots easily. This should be a relatively small city. I also enjoy places where you can curate a community, a place where there are only a handful of restaurants or bars. Then you begin to know the locals and other people there more intimately. Again, I prefer places with beautiful nature, beaches or mountains, which offer unique or challenging experiences. Now that I have painted a pretty zoomed in picture of my prefer locations and type of travel I will highlight some places you may want to check out. They are lowkey so do not share it too much. One of my favorite trips was to Dominical, Costa Rica. Everyone knows Costa Rica is a nice destination, but everyone goes to the same places. Dominical is a tiny local town on the southeast coast of CR where you can walk everywhere shirtless and shoeless and surf all day. You can enjoy local cuisine, find waterfalls in the jungle and enjoy beautiful sunsets. This location has the culture integration, small authentic community feel, and challenging unique experiences. Next I want to highlight Lagos, Portugal. In the south of Portugal you can find beautiful authentic tiny beach towns. Lagos is a tiny touristy but still has the local feel. This is really just a vibe spot to go on the beach and eat insane seafood. As you can see beaches and beach activities are a great way to spend time in a healthy and fun way for me. I think the same experience can be achieved in a mountain town. I really enjoy snowboarding so any snowboarding town could work. I have not found one which checks all these boxes because I have not snowboarded outside the USA. I think Zermatt Switzerland would work for this. On the note of mountains I guess I will highlight Seydisfjordur, Iceland. This is a picturesque walkable mountain town in the north eastern part of Iceland. Not much to do but just take in the beauty and culture. All this is to say that Koh Tao is beautiful, has cool activities like snorkeling, but is way too touristy and has pretty much no Thai culture. The places I am looking for must have the authentic feel. Going forward for the next leg of this trip I think I can find some really lowkey gems I look forward to sharing.`,

    excerpt: 'Christmas day adventure exploring Koh Tao by motorbike, snorkeling with sea turtles, and discovering hidden beaches.',
    content: `Woke up this morning and got a Thai milk tea at the tiki bar next to my hostel. After Zach and I rented a motorbike to explore the hard to get to parts of the island. We first stopped off at Shark Bay, a small little bay great for snorkeling. I really loved the vibe there. It was small and the tiki bar played reggae. I had a phenomenal passionfruit and mango shake there. This was the first time being away from the main touristy area and it was really nice. The water was really blue and beautiful. I rented a snorkel and went for a nice long swim. I saw beautiful colored parrot fish and even a rare sea turtle. This experience made coming to Koh Tao worth it. I at first was disappointed by it being too touristy but when you take a motorbike to the farther places from the center you get to see the majestic beauty of the island. A tropical jungle with beautiful aquatic life. It was some of the most beautiful water I have seen. While snorkeling I noticed a lot of dead or bleached coral. Coral bleaching occurs when corals expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, called zooxanthellae, which are essential for their health and vibrant coloration. This phenomenon happens as a stress response to environmental changes, particularly: Rising Sea Temperatures: The most common cause is prolonged exposure to elevated sea surface temperatures due to global warming. A mere one degree celsius change in water temperature can destroy coral reefs and aquatic habitats. On my travels I have really seen the starting effects of climate change first hand. City centers are over polluted and crowded, cold climates such as Nepal and Georgia are seeing less snow, and sea temperature levels are rising. We all need to do our part to help minimize greenhouse emissions to reduce global warming. After snorkeling in Shark bay Zach and I had lunch at Eagle's View. I ordered a grilled whole grouper. The waitress said her dad is a fisherman and caught the fish fresh today and I hand picked the exact fish I was going to eat. I was surprised they have grouper in the gulf of Thailand. It was really yummy but Florida grouper still reigns supreme. I explored some other lowkey beaches with the motorbike and finally found a good beach to skimboard! Hopefully tomorrow I can go back and try to ride. At sunset Zach and I went to Mango viewpoint, a high viewpoint on the mountain. It was beautiful and relaxing. It was a pain getting the motorbike up and down the mountain but it was well worth it. After sunset I got a 10 dollar haircut on the side of the road from a Thai woman. It is crazy how much you can learn about business from these small business owners. This woman has a single chair on the main walking road of Koh Tao. Everyone can see her working and how many clients she has. She has been completely full the past three days. It really proves how real estate is king, location matters, and seeing is believing. People are more inclined to pay for a service, whether it is a rock climbing gym, haircut, or club if they see the vibe and the traffic going through the place.`,

    excerpt: 'An action-packed day in Koh Tao with Muay Thai training, beach volleyball, and exploring the Israeli backpacker scene.',
    content: `Today was a very active day. I woke up and went to the beach to do some push ups and stretches. After waking up my body I walked the beach and the streets of Koh Tao to get an understanding of the city. I always like aimlessly wandering a new place, you always seem to stumble upon some cool places. I spent the majority of the morning running around the island looking for a working ATM. All of the shops and restaurants here only accept cash. After going to over 5 different ATMS and none of them working I gave up and decided to go read some of my book. Zach and I met up for lunch around 1300 at Flower restaurant and we had really good mango sticky rice and pad Thai. In the afternoon I played footvolley with some Israelis on the beach. The beach near my hostel is literally filled with Israelis. It is almost like they just all came from Tel Aviv to this 10m strip of beach in Koh Tao, doing the same exact things. After a good round of footvolley I went to train Muay Thai at a local gym. This was my first time properly training and I learned the proper footwork and form. I never realized how tactical and precise martial arts is. From the angle you throw a punch to the timing of the footwork to make sure you are balanced. I really enjoyed the two hour session and I learned a lot. It was a really good workout too, working my whole body. After finishing Muay Thai I went to the beach to catch sunset. To my surprise a beach volleyball net was set up, my favorite! I was able to play three games and played really well. I like beach volleyball a lot. At night Zach and I met up again and had a great dinner. I had a full white snapper. We drank some kombucha after dinner instead of alcohol to not ruin the active, healthy day I had.`,

    excerpt: 'The challenging journey from mainland Thailand to Koh Tao island, including a brutal ferry ride and first impressions.',
    content: `Woke up at 5am to catch the bus + ferry to the island of Koh Tao. It seems like just yesterday I was struggling on the bus in Nepal. This country has paved roads and the bus is a double decker with water provided. The tourism infrastructure here is insane. When I got to my taxi this morning I saw the street vendors already setting up, most of them elderly. They really work hard for a couple dollars a day, hopefully more. I realized I really loved being on the frontier. Going to places untouched by too many tourists, a touch underdeveloped and really out in the world. Thailand is not that place but hopefully the beaches and sceneries are as beautiful as people say. I am looking forward already to being in the rural farms of Laos, instead of the largest tourist destination in the world, Bangkok. I'm still confused why families bring their little kids here with people blowing weed smoke everywhere. There's not much to do except eat cheap food and party. The 6 hour bus ride to the coast was pretty easy because I had a seat to myself and slept 75% of the time. Around 1300 we boarded a two hour ferry from the coast to the island of Koh Tao. These two hours were some of the most brutal. The choppiness of the water was unbelievable. People were being thrown from side to side of the catamaran. I was really fighting not to pass out or throw up. I felt squeamish to the max. I focused on a single point in the boat and tried to dial in. After the two hours of the boat ride passed I reached the shore so relieved. My entire body was tingling and my energy drained. This afternoon Zach and I were able to briefly explore the island of Koh Tao. It is very touristy as well but has nice beaches and jungle landscapes. I saw a sign for renting a skimboard and hopefully I can ride tomorrow. I used to love skim boarding the beaches of Florida and I like it because it's a lowkey sport. Excited for what unfolds here in this week in the beautiful island of Koh Tao.`,
