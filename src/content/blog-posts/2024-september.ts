    excerpt: 'The start of my world adventure, from the final days in Florida to the first experiences in Israel.',
    content: `September 2024 marked the beginning of what would become the most transformative year of my life. After months of planning and preparation, I finally took the leap and began my journey around the world, starting in Israel.

**Leaving Florida**
Saying goodbye to family and friends in Florida was harder than I expected. After years of talking about this trip, it was finally happening. The mixture of excitement and nervousness was overwhelming as I headed to the airport with just a backpack and a one-way ticket.

**First Steps in Israel**
Landing in Tel Aviv, I immediately felt the energy of this complex and fascinating country. Israel was the perfect place to start this journey - a country where ancient history meets cutting-edge technology, where every conversation is passionate, and where I could ease into travel while staying connected to my Jewish roots.

**Jerusalem - Spiritual Awakening**
Spending time in Jerusalem was profoundly moving. Walking through the Old City, touching the Western Wall, and experiencing Shabbat in one of the world's holiest cities set the spiritual tone for my entire journey.

**Tel Aviv - Modern Energy**
Tel Aviv showed me Israel's modern, cosmopolitan side. The beach culture, startup scene, and incredible food made it clear why this city is considered the Miami of the Middle East.

**Connecting with Locals**
What struck me most was how welcoming Israelis were. Despite the country's complex political situation, people opened their homes and hearts to me. I stayed with families, shared Shabbat dinners, and learned about Israeli culture from the inside.

**Setting the Stage**
Israel taught me that travel isn't just about seeing new places - it's about connecting with people, understanding different perspectives, and challenging your own assumptions. These lessons would guide me through every country that followed.

Looking back now, I couldn't have chosen a better place to start this incredible adventure. Israel prepared me for the year ahead and reminded me that no matter how far you travel, human connection is what makes the journey meaningful.`,
